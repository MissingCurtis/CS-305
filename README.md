<li>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</li>
<p>Artemis Financial develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. I was to add a file verification step to their web application and a data verification step in the form of a checksum. I have been asked to add secure communication mechanisms to meet their software security requirements. I need to deliver a production quality integrated application that includes secure coding protocols.</p>
<li>What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?</li>
<p>I think I did well on using Owasp in conjunction with the vunerabilty chart to identify existing security risks. Secure coding improves the companies value, giving the company value to the customers the work with through peace of mind.</p>
<li>What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?</li>
<p>Owasp was the most valuable and the most annoying. You really have to go through what is what, and you have to sift through alot of repeatitve information to try and find a fix. I wish it was more organized, stating upfront the fix or that there is no fix.</p>
<li>How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?</li>
<p>I think running Owasp first then updating the code to mitagate Owasp vunerabilities and then doing a manual review is better. Fixing Owasp found issues may inturn fix manual review found issues.</p>
<li>How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</li>
<p>I first ran Owasp, then what I wasn't going to be working on created a suppression file for. Did the refactor then a manual review, after ran Owasp again if nothing popped up I should be good.</p>
<li>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?</li>
<p>I know I have mentioned it alot but Owasp and secure coding was invaluable to doing a good job.</p>
<li>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?</li>
<p>The refactored code is a good example of the use of Owasp.</p>
